        <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl text-amber-500">Difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
        <div class="font-bold m-8 text-2xl"> local storage is also
            permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser.but the session storage is impermanent.
            When we want try open a website that previously used local storage, it will always have access to that stored data,where session storage are not.

        <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl text-amber-500">Difference between function level scope and block level scope?</h1>
        <div class="font-bold m-8 text-2xl"> A function scoped variable means that the variable defined within a function will not accessible from outside the
            function. on the other hand, A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be
            accessible from outside the block. 
            Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function. let & const  are block scope except var.        </div>

        <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl text-amber-500">What is an event loop in JavaScript?</h1>
       
        <div class="font-bold m-8 text-2xl">The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single
        thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

        <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl text-amber-500">finds many types of undefined?</h1>
       
        <div class="font-bold m-8 text-2xl">We can also use the type of the variable to check if it’s undefined. Luckily for us undefined is a datatype for an
        undefined value as you can see below: ‌An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return "undefined" in JavaScript. This is not the same as
        null, despite the fact that both imply an empty state.
